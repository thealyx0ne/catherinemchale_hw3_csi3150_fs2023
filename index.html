        <p>
          Iceland, a Nordic island nation, is defined by its dramatic landscape
          with volcanoes, geysers, hot springs and lava fields. Massive glaciers
          are protected in Vatnajökull and Snæfellsjökull national parks. Most of
          the population lives in the capital, Reykjavik, which runs on geothermal
          power and is home to the National and Saga museums, tracing Iceland’s
          Viking history. <br />
          <br />

              "This was a fantastic experience! From the lagoons to the waterfalls,
              glaciers to geysers, the mountains and volcanoes, everything about this trip was
              perfect. We stayed for 5 days and there was never a dull moment while we
              were here. My spouse and I took a one day glacier walk guided tour and
              it was the most beautiful sight. We will definitely look into your other tours in
               the future. Thank you for a memorable experience!"
